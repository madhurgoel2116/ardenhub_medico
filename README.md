Welcome to the **ArDenHub Medico** repository! This FiveM script provides players with a unique way to request medical assistance when they are incapacitated. If there are no medics available on the server, players can pay a fee to be revived. This system enhances gameplay and offers an alternative to traditional medical services.

## Features

- **Revival System**: Players can request revival when dead.
- **Payment System**: A fee is required for revival, adding a strategic element.
- **No Medics Required**: Works independently of in-game medics.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup for server administrators.
- **Customizable Options**: Modify settings to fit your server's needs.

## Installation

To install the ArDenHub Medico script, follow these steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases](https://github.com/madhurgoel2116/ardenhub_medico/releases) section.
2. **Extract the downloaded files** to your server's resource directory.
3. **Add the resource** to your server configuration file (`server.cfg`) with the line:
   ```
   start ardenhub_medico
   ```
4. **Restart your server** to apply the changes.

## Usage

Once installed, players can use the following command to request medical assistance:

```
/requestmedic
```

Players will be prompted to pay a set fee. If they agree, they will be revived at their last location.

### Example

1. A player dies in-game.
2. They type `/requestmedic`.
3. The system prompts them for payment.
4. Upon successful payment, they are revived.

## Configuration

The script includes a configuration file where you can customize various settings. You can adjust:

- **Revival Fee**: Set the amount players must pay for revival.
- **Cooldown Time**: Determine how often players can request revival.
- **Messages**: Customize the messages players receive.

### Configuration Example

```lua
Config = {}

Config.RevivalFee = 500  -- Set revival fee to $500
Config.CooldownTime = 300 -- 5 minutes cooldown
Config.Messages = {
    requestReceived = "Your request for medical assistance has been received.",
    paymentSuccess = "Payment successful! You are being revived.",
    paymentFailed = "Payment failed. Please try again."
}
```
